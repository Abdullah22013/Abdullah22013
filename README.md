## üéØ Projects

[Gender and Emotion Classification using Speech/Voice using ML models](https://github.com/Abdullah22013/Gender-and-Emotion-Classification-using-Voice-.git) 

**Tech Stack:**  Python, Scikit-learn, LibROSA, PCA, t-SNE, Random Forest, SVM, Matplotlib, PyTorch

This project involves building a machine-learning solution to classify gender and emotions based on speech audio. The solution leverages techniques like MFCC feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and advanced visualization.

Key accomplishments:

* Achieved 97% accuracy for gender recognition using SVM.
* Designed an emotion classification model with 76% accuracy using Random Forest.
* Addressed challenges like noise reduction and feature selection to improve model performance.

Future work includes enhancing real-time emotion detection capabilities and exploring multilingual datasets for wider applicability.


[Self Driving Car Simulation](https://github.com/Abdullah22013/Self-Driving-Car-Simulation.git) 

**Tech Stack:** NumPy, Pandas, OpenCv, CARLA simulator, Image Filtering and Image Segmentation libraries.

This project developed a motion planning stack for autonomous vehicles, enabling obstacle avoidance, lane tracking, and stop sign handling. Tested in the CARLA simulator, it demonstrated robust performance in dynamic environments. Future work includes enhancing behavioral logic and integrating real-time perception.

 
[Car Price Prediction Model](https://github.com/Abdullah22013/Car-Price-Prediction-Model.git) 

**Tech Stack:** This project uses the libraries and frameworks such as: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Flask, Joblib.

The goal of this project is to predict the selling price of a car based on features such as present price, kilometers driven, ownership, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and the year of the car model. Two regression models are used: Linear Regression and Lasso Regression.


[Assembler and Simulator for a given ISA](https://github.com/Abdullah22013/Assembler-and-Simulator-for-a-given-ISA.git)

**Tech Stack:** Python

Designed and implemented a custom assembler and simulator for a 16-bit ISA with various instructions like addition, subtraction, move, load, store, multiply, divide, shift, logical operations, comparisons, and jumps. The assembler converted assembly code to binary machine code for the ISA. It handled instruction formats, labels, variables, and error handling.
The simulator executed the binary code, simulating the ISA components like Memory, Program Counter, Register File, and Execution Engine. It printed the state after each instruction and the memory dump after halting. The project provided hands-on experience in designing system software components like assemblers and simulators for a custom ISA specification, handling binary encoding, and extending functionality.
